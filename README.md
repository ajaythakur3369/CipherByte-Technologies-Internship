## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects: 

- **Iris Flowers Classification -** Classified different **Species of Iris Flowers** using **Logistic**, **SVM**, **Decision Tree**, **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, and **KNN** regression ML models. Additionally, created **K-means Clustering** algorithm using **Elbow** method with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

- **Spam Email Detection -** Developed a **Spam Email Detection Model** that can **Classify** emails as **Spam** or **Non-Spam** based on their **Content** using **Logistic** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

- **Time Series Forecasting -** Forecasted **Humidity and Temperature** of **Kolkata** using **Prophet Time Series** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others.

- **Unemployment Analysis -** Analyzed **Unemployment Rate** during **COVID-19** in different **States of India** using **Python** Programming language with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others.
